## Deploy the back end and run the app

1. Clone the repo, check out the Expo branch, & install the dependencies

```sh
~ git clone https://github.com/adefemi171/Project_App

~ cd Project_App


~ npm install
```

2. Initialize and deploy the Amplify project

```sh
~ amplify init

? Enter a name for the environment: dev (or whatever you would like to call this env)
? Choose your default editor: <YOUR_EDITOR_OF_CHOICE>
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Y

~ amplify push

? Are you sure you want to continue? Y
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API? N

> We already have the GraphQL code generated for this project, so generating it here is not necessary.
```

3. Start the app

```sh
~ expo start
```

## To populate the database with your conference speakers

1. Sign up in the app after following the previous steps

2. Open the AppSync console:

```sh
~ amplify console api
```

3. Click on __Queries__ to open the GraphiQL Editor. When prompted to "Login with User Pools", you can login with your new username and use the `aws_user_pools_web_client_id` located in __aws-exports.js__ for the ClientId.

4. Create a new talk with the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation createTalk {
  createTalk(input: {
    name: "Observabilty Engineering",

      location
      speakerAvatar
    }
  }
}
```

6. Update a talk with the following GraphQL mutation:

    name: "Performance in React Native & GraphQL"
  }) {
    id name
  }
}
```

7. Delete a talk with the following GraphQL mutation:

~ amplify push
```
